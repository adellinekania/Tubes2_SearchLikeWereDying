## General Information
This program is a program that implements the BFS and DFS algorithms with a folder crawling technique, where the computer engine will search for files that match the query from the starting directory to all the children of starting directory until the first file/all files are found or no files are found. <br/>
The program created is a simple GUI application which can model the features of the file explorer on the operating system, which in this task is called
with Folder Crawl. In addition, there is also a visualization of the results of search for these folders in the form of trees, folder browsing sequence routes, and hyperlinks to the files being searched.

## Requirement
- [Visual Studio .NET](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [C#](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [MSAGL Library](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-automatic-graph-layout/)

## How To Run
First, clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/adellinekania/Tubes1_BeatingMarioKart.git
```
Go to bin folder and simply double click the ```FolderCrawling```
